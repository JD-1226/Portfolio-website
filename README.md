## 🎯 Project Description & Purpose

This portfolio website was built to showcase the works, skills, and identity of a UX/UI designer (Pravin). My role was to develop the entire website structure: landing pages, project galleries, skills sections, contact forms, and visual transitions. The purpose is to present a **clean, interactive, and responsive digital persona** — so visitors (recruiters, clients) can intuitively navigate Pravin’s design portfolio.

## 📋 What Went Right / Challenges & How They Were Resolved

| Challenge                             | How It Was Solved                                                                       |

| Ensuring pixel-perfect responsiveness | Used fluid layouts, flexbox / grid, media queries, and tested on multiple device widths |
| Smooth navigation & anchoring         | Implemented scroll behavior using JS (or CSS `scroll-behavior`)                         |
| Consistent design across pages        | Created a shared CSS structure, variables for colors, and reused visual patterns        |
| Asset optimization                    | Compressed images, used webp or appropriate formats to reduce load time                 |
| Deploy & routing                      | Configured Netlify build settings, correct base paths so direct links work              |
| Maintaining content scalability       | Structured HTML so new project pages can be added without breaking layout               |
